This code is almost entirely from 3D Slicer 4, an existing open source project: http://www.slicer.org/

This in particular is a minor edit of an existing module:
http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/PETStandardUptakeValueComputation

I cannot guarantee that this code works correctly as is.
